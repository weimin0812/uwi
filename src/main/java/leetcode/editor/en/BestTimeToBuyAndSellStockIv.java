//Say you have an array for which the i-th element is the price of a given stock
// on day i. 
//
// Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most k tr
//ansactions. 
//
// Note: 
//You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sel
//l the stock before you buy again). 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [2,4,1], k = 2
//Output: 2
//Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 
//4-2 = 2.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [3,2,6,5,0,3], k = 2
//Output: 7
//Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 
//6-2 = 4.
//Â             Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), prof
//it = 3-0 = 3.
