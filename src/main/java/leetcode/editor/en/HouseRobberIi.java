//You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each hous
//e has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged i
//n a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhil
//e, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically cont
//act the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night. 
//
// Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of eac
//h house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alert
//ing the police. 
//
// Example 1: 
//
// 
//Input: [2,3,2]
//Output: 3
//Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 
//2),
//             because they are adjacent houses.
// 
//
// Example 2: 
//
// 
//Input: [1,2,3,1]
//Output: 4
//Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
//             Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
